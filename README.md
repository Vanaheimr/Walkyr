GEXFSharp
=================

A GEXF Graph File Format Library for .NET and Mono.

About
------------------
The GEXF Graph File Format Library is based on the [gexf4j-core](http://github.com/jmcampanini/gexf4j-core) library for Java. It supports [GEXF 1.1](http://gexf.net/format/index.html) and thus can be used to read and write GEXF files for visualizing graphs using Gephi and any other GEXF-supporting application like graph-databases.
